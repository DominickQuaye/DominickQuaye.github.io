    <p>
      This device was built out of mainly scrap parts over 6 months (I am still upgrading it daily). It creates
      plasma through a process called inertial electrostatic confinement, or IEC. The basic layout consists of a vacuum
      chamber with an anode and cathode, a vacuum system to generate the vacuum, a HV power supply, and a gas injection
      system. The voltage potential between the central cathode wire cage and the chamber anode (-2.1kV to -8kV depending on which power supply I use),
      ionizes
      the gas and accelerates it inward, giving some of the individual ions temperatures in the 10s of millions of degrees. Some of these ions collide in the center, forming a plasma.
      Currently I have created Nitrogen plasma with the trace amounts of remaining air after a vacuum pump down, and regular
      hydrogen, synthesized by combining Aluminum shavings and 0.1 M Sodium Hydroxide. See images of ambient air nitrogen
      plasma and general setup below. The plasma in the pictures was created at ~2.1kV with a chamber pressure of ~50 microns. You can see a video of the device
      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yta61JYQPxuIaMlZLbIGK9HwFhgoxrvR/view">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Vacuum System</h2>
    <p>
      The vacuum system for the plasma generator is a Welch 8920A oil sealed rotary vane pump. I fully disassembled and
      refurbished it over the course of 6 months after getting it off ebay in terrible condition ( It was bad because I
      bought it for 200$ and they are usually sold for over $3000). This pump was connected to the chamber with a few
      feet
      3/4in ID PVC tubing using metal compression sleeves. (The gas ballast stays closed during operation). The chamber
      pressure is measured with a VG64 digital vacuum gauge that is connected to the chamber by a series of flange
      adapters sealed with epoxy. The guage's 0.5 micron resolution gives me a really good picture of the true
      pressure
      conditions. See internal mechanics, homemade part replacements, and before and after pics below

    <h2>Cage and HV vacuum feedthrough</h2>
    <p>
      I made my own HV feedthrough that feeds the cathode into the chamber without shorting it to the chamber or causing
      leaks. I did this by drilling a 1½" hole in an old grinding wheel from a scrap dump, placing the stainless steel
      cage I built inside of it, sealing the bottom, and pouring in marine epoxy to fill the hole. The epoxy binds to
      the
      edges of everything it touches forming a seal, and its dielectric properties prevent a short. In a more recent
      generation I used Sodium Silicate instead of epoxy because it's a better dielectric, completely heat resistant
      (the
      cage gets really hot from the plasma), and off-gasses less, helping me reach a higher vacuum. The most up to date
      iteration is liquid-cooled, allowing for my demo fusor to operate for hours at a time

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">This sodium silicate feedthrough was made by slowly filling a large hole in the center of the plate around the cage. As the sodium ilicate dried it formed a layer of glass behind it. This was done layer by layer to prevent air pockets and cracking. While it was heat resistant, I moved on because its dielectric properites were not as great as I expected. My guess is that small gaps within the glass allowed for corona and eventiually arcing. /figcaption>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">The cage is made of very low diameter (0.098in) OD tubing from Ace Hardware. I bent it into a 2 loop cage using a simple grid winding jig.The inlet of the cage extends 3" past the feedthrough to connect to the "pump" with a small rubber coupler. The outlet is about 1" long and just bends down to let the coolant out into the collecting tray. My "pump" is just a 3-gallon jug with some more tubing inserted and sealed on. The water pressure from the 3-Gallon jug provides a flow rate through the cage of about 0.25 ml/second. This flow rate is enough to sufficiently cool the cage while barley depleting the water supply. With this cooling setup, I can now run my Demo Fusor for 2+ hours straight. In my first run, I found that the water heated up ~3C after going through the cage. (went from 18C to 21C) You can see the setup <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yta61JYQPxuIaMlZLbIGK9HwFhgoxrvR/view">here</a>.</figcaption>

    <h2>Chamber (Generation 2)</h2>
    <p>
      The front window is 1" by 7" by 7" acrylic from a plastics store. The custom bolts I made compress the
      flange-feedthrough and the window onto the gaskets on both sides of the chamber, forming a seal. The gaskets are
      made from EDPM synthetic rubber. I cut them out of a large sheet with scissors. The chamber is made of 5 inch ID
      stainless steel tubing with 3 outlets of 3/4in OD stainless tubing welded on. Credit to Calvin Holmes for the
      welding. The small hairline fractures in the welds were sealed with Sodium Silicate. The third outlet is sealed
      off
      in the plasma images but is used for gas injection.

    <h2>Chamber (Generation 1)</h2>
    <p>
      The first generation chamber was different in that it had a far more archaic method for flange-gasket compression. I connected 4 aluminum bars to 4 sets of standoffs, forming crude brackets that I slid on the chamber and cinched down. There were a number of issues with this setup that led me to make the improvements seen in generation 2 above. The first was ease of use. The brackets were extremely tedious to get on and off, meaning it was very hard to switch between the multiple feedthrough flanges I had made. The second, more important issue, was uniform gasket compression and leak detection. The brackets were hard to keep in one place on the faces of the chamber, meaning that it was almost impossible to compress the gasket perfectly. This made leak detection a major issue because I never knew whether the cause of the leak was bracket alignment or an actual connection. This was resolved in the 2nd generation by replacing the old feedthrough flanges with larger square aluminum plates that could accept 4 fixed bolts.

    <h2>2.1kv DC @200 mA power supply</h2>
    <p>
      This 1st generation HV system consists of a variable water resistor for current control, a variac, and a center tapped 2.1kv transformer I sourced from a microwave. This feeds into a full bridge rectifier made from diodes I also took out of a microwave. Finally, two 1uF microwave oven capacitors in parallel smooth the still fluctuating rectified DC to create a more “true” DC waveform. This provides the negative polarity 2.1kvdc needed for the device. I have since upgraded to a far more advanced 8kV and now 20kV voltage multiplier which can be found in the
      <a href="https://dominickquaye.github.io/electrical.html">electronics section</a>.
      of this site. They are also pictured below.
