    <h2>8kV DC @50mA Half Wave Cockroft-Walton voltage multiplier</h2>
    <p>
      This voltage multiplier is the most recent iteration of my Demo Fusor
      power supply. It is a 4 stage Half Wave Cockroft-Walton voltage
      multiplyer. The voltage multiplier, as the name implies, multiplies the
      input AC voltage by the number of stages. Thus it has a ~8kV output
      (accounting for voltage drop) when given a 2100VAC input from a
      Microwave Oven transformer. The multiplier works on the principle of
      charging the capacitors in parallel and then discharging them in series.
      This is done by adding a diode array similar to a half-wave rectifier
      along the multiplyer. This also results in a negative DC output from the
      multiplyer. Every diode and capacitor in the multiplyer (as well as the
      driving transformer) was salvaged from a broken microwave for free.

      <h2>36v @250A Stick welder</h2>

      <p>
        I made this fully functional 250A Stick welder by repurposing two large
        1kW transformers from 2 broken microwaves. I first drilled out the
        secondary winding and cracked the welds open using an angle grinder.
        Using a custom wood jig, I wound a coil of 8 gauge stranded copper wire
        6 turns high and 3 turns wide for a total of 18 turns. The new coils
        were then removed from the jig, taped up, and pressed back into the
        transformer. I then reattached the base plate I had grinded off with
        epoxy. Next I attached the power cable from the microwave to the
        transformers in series using some cable connectors. I crimped little
        sections of scrap copper pipe to the ends of the secondary to provide
        good high current connections to the welding cable. This entire setup
        was screwed down onto a small piece of plywood for convenience. To reach
        the 36v @250A output goal, the power supply needs a 240v input. So the
        final measure to make the welder work was taking two hot leads (180
        degrees out of phase) from two isolated circuits in my house and
        connecting them to the single cable feeding into the supply. Although it
        looks a little sketchy this device can output more current than many
        commercial hobby welders, and is capable of making solid welds even on
        stainless steel.

      <h2>4.4kv DC @200 mA power supply</h2>
      <p>
        This setup uses two MOTs connected in series (with the center tapped
        cores paired together as well) out of phase, giving a 4.2kv output. I
        have used this supply for numerous applications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          By hooking it up to my variable water resistor, variac, and full bridge
          microwave diode rectifier, I used this supply to get higher energy
          plasma in the generator for a short time before I built my voltage
          multiplier
        </li>
        <li>
          By adding longer cables to the leads I can use it to make a
          lichtenberg figure with slightly different shapes (due to the higher
          voltage).
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, I mainly use this supply to make cool arcs which can be seen
          below.
        </li>

      <h2>10 KIlowatt, 0-150 KΩ Variable water resistor</h2>
      <p>
        I made this variable water resistor originally to ballast/current limit
        my Demo Fusor power supply, but It has turned out to be an extremely
        versatile device. I have now used it to control the current of my stick
        welder, lichtenberg fractal burner, as well as a number of other smaller
        safety applications at mains voltages. The device was made entirely out
        of scrap parts. The tub is made of a dog food container I found in a
        dumpster. The lid is simple scrap plywood with holes drilled out for the
        two electrodes. The Electrodes are made of crushed copper tubing (also
        from scrap) which are connected to some small ï¿½ï¿½ pvc sections. One
        electrode is fixed in the device, and the other is placed on an axle
        taken from a broken printer. The axel is fed through the pvc handle into
        two pine blocks on either side, forming a crude ï¿½bearingï¿½ which
        allows the handle to rotate freely. The tub is filled with water mixed
        with about a gram of sodium hydroxide (adds free ions to the water
        reducing losses). By moving the handle the distance between the
        electrodes can be varied from 0-8ï¿½. The further current has to travel
        through the resistive solution, the higher the resistance, so as a
        result this distance translates to a resistance of anywhere from 0 Ohms
        to 150 Kilohms. I designed this device to be very high power by using
        low gauge wire for all connections, making large electrodes, and having
        a large volume of solution to slow the rate of heating. I have used this
        resistor to ballast my 36v welder at 250A and only experienced moderate
        heating of the device, giving it a possible power rating of 10KW.
