    <h2>8kV DC @50mA Half Wave Cockroft-Walton voltage multiplier</h2>
    <p>
      This voltage multiplier is the most recent iteration of my Demo Fusor power supply. It is a 4 stage Half Wave Cockroft-Walton voltage multiplyer. The voltage multiplier, as the name implies, multiplies the input AC voltage by the number of stages. Thus it has a ~8kV output (accounting for voltage drop) when given a 2100VAC input from a Microwave Oven transformer. The multiplier works on the principle of charging the capacitors in parallel and then discharging them in series. This is done by adding a diode array similar to that of a half-wave rectifier along the multiplyer. This also results in a negative DC output from the multiplyer. Every diode and capacitor in the multiplyer (as well as the driving transformer) was salvaged from broken microwaves for free.

      <p>
        I made this fully functional 250A Stick welder by repurposing two large 1.2kW transformers from  2 broken microwaves. I first drilled out the secondary winding and cut the welds holding the transformer together using an angle grinder. This allowed me to remove the remaining pieces of the secondary as well as the magnetic shunts within the transformer (the shunts are meant to limit the current draw, but I don't want that because high current is essential for quality welds).  Using a custom wooden jig I made from scrap wood, I wound a coil of 8 gauge stranded copper wire 6 turns high and 3 turns wide for a total of 18 turns. The new coils were then removed from the jig, taped up, and pressed back into the transformer, changing the turns ratio dramatically from its original 17.5 to less than 1. I then reattached the base plate I had grinded off with epoxy. Next I attached the power cable from the microwave to the transformers in series using some cable connectors. I crimped little sections of scrap copper pipe to the ends of the secondary to provide good high current connections to the welding cable. This entire setup was screwed down onto a small piece of plywood for convenience. To reach the 36v @250A output goal, the power supply needs a 240v input. So the final measure to make the welder work was taking two hot leads (180 degrees out of phase) from two isolated circuits in my house and connecting them to the single cable feeding into the supply. Although it looks a little sketchy this device can output more current than many commercial hobby welders, and is capable of making solid welds even on thick stainless steel.

      <h2>4.4kv DC @200 mA power supply</h2>
      <p>
        This setup uses two MOTs connected in series (with the center tapped
        cores paired together as well) out of phase, giving a 4.2kv output. I
        have used this supply for numerous applications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          By hooking it up to my variable water resistor, variac, and full bridge
          microwave diode rectifier, I used this supply to get higher energy
          plasma in the generator for a short time before I built my voltage
          multiplier
        </li>
        <li>
          By adding longer cables to the leads I can use it to make a
          lichtenberg figure with slightly different shapes (due to the higher
          voltage).
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, I mainly use this supply to make cool arcs which can be seen
          below.

      <h2>10 KIlowatt, 0-150 KΩ Variable water resistor</h2>
      <p>
        I made this variable water resistor originally to ballast/current limit my Demo Fusor power supply, but It has turned out to be an extremely versatile device. I have now used it to control the current of my stick welder, Lichtenberg fractal burner, as well as a number of other projects. The device was made entirely out of scrap parts. The tub is made of a dog food container I found in a dumpster. The lid is simple scrap plywood with holes drilled out for the two electrodes. The electrodes are made of crushed copper tubing (also from scrap) which are connected to some small ½” pvc sections. One electrode is fixed in the device, and the other is placed on an axle taken from a broken printer. The axel is fed through the pvc handle into two pine blocks on either side, forming a crude “bearing” which allows the handle to rotate freely. The tub is filled with water mixed with about a gram of sodium hydroxide (the ions in the water make it more conductive, reducing voltage drop across the ballast). By moving the handle the distance between the electrodes can be varied from 0-8”. The further current has to travel through the resistive solution, the higher the resistance, so as a result this distance translates to a resistance of anywhere from 0 Ohms to 150 Kilohms. I designed this device to be very high power by using low gauge wire for all connections, making large electrodes, and having a large volume of solution to slow the rate of heating. I have used this resistor to ballast my 36v welder at 250A and only experienced moderate heating of the device, giving it a possible (short burst)power rating of 10KW.
