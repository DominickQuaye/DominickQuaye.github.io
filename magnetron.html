    <h1>DC Sputtering Magnetron (In progress)</h1>
    <p>What is sputtering? What is a magnetron? What does this device do?</p>

    <p>Sputtering describes the ejection of microscopic particles from a solid material after the material is hit with other energetic particles (in this case the particles that make up the plasma).</p>

    <p>A core tenent of all magnetrons is the use magnetic feilds to influence the movement of electrons within a vaccum environment.</p>

    <p>So to combine these two, we basically have a vaccum chamber that uses a magnetic field to control the movement of energetic charged
    particles in a way that slams them into a target material (usually a metal) and displaces microscopic amounts of it.
    Those particles then travel and deposit onto objects you place in the chamber.</p>

    <p>Essentially this device can coat anything you want with a thin film of atomically pure metal(you can do non-metals as well but I havent gottem the chance to try yet).
    There are alot of potential uses for this ranging from computer manufacturing to flexible thin circuts to art.</p>

    <p>To go into a little more depth here is a great picture I found of how the prosses works:</p>

    <figure class="figure my-auto col-md-12">
      <img src="magnetron/Feildlines.PNG" />
      <figcaption class="figure-caption"> At the top and bottom of the screen you can see an anode and cathode between which a voltage is applied (in my case 2.1kV).
      This turns the gas within the chamber into a plasma. At the very bottom of the screen you can see two red and one blue rectangles. These are cross sections of a
      outer ring magnet(red) and inner cylindrical magnet (blue). The curved white lines above them show their field lines. As you can see the field lines of
      the outer magnet flow into that of the inner one, forming a "m". If you imagine this shape in 3D it is kind of like bundt-tray-shaped magnetic field. This field moves the plasma
      within the chamber around alot meaning that it cannot become concentrated, however there is a small "deadzone" in the magnetic feild near the cathode plate and directly inbetween
      the magnets where the plasma isnt scattered by the field but instead confined by it on all sides. This area of concentrated plasma is the two bright green spots near the bottom. Again if
      you imagine this in 3D its really a doughnut shape. So basically this device is similar to my IEC Demo fusor at the top of this website. Both are plasma confinement devices: one uses electrostatic
      confinement, and one uses magnetic. This doughnut of high density plasma sits right on top of the cathode/target material. By intentioally confining the plasma (high energy particles) here,
      the sputtering rate is vastly increased because the argon atoms that need to hit the material being sputtered are pressed right up against it. This is what makes magnetron sputtering one of
      the faster meathods of sputtering. This is basically all there is too it. The yellow stuff in the center of the screen moving upwards is the atoms that have been displaced from the target
      material. They go up and attach to the substrate(thing you want to coat).
      </figcaption>

    <p>*Note his is an ongoing prodject because I need an argon tank to run it. I hope to get one within the next month and then I will post the results. </p>

  <h2>Magnetic confinement setup</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>As described at the top of this page, To form the cathode and magnetic confinement setup I needed to place a strong cylintrical magnet inside a strong ring magnet, and place it below the cathode/sputtering target material. Because of the heat generated by the plasma can demagnitize the magnets, they also need to be liquid cooled. Follow the captions below for an explination of the build prosses.</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
  <figure class="figure my-auto col-md-4">
    <img src="magnetron/IMG_0145.JPG" />
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">To begin I had to source a strong ring magnet. I got mine for free from... (you guessed it) a microwave magnetron. The magnetron still in the microwave is circled here. I am basically taking a magnet from one magnetron(cavity) and using it to make another(sputtering). </figcaption>

    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Here are the cylindrical magnets I placed inside. I had to buy them because randomly finding a magnet that fit perfectly in the ring one would have been really hard. On the outside (the white thing) you can see an early test of my 3D-printed spacing ring. This is needed because the central magnets need to be in the exact center of the ring magnets for the field to flow in uniformly. </figcaption>

  <h2>Cathode/target</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>My target is a copper plate, but one thick enough to not buckle under vaccum was way too expensive. So I decided to make a reinforcing back plate out of cheap steel and epoxy it on to the copper one.</p>
  <div class="row justify-content-center">
  <figure class="figure my-auto col-md-4">
    <img src="magnetron/IMG_0290.JPEG" />
    <figcaption class="figure-caption"> I started by cutting a hole in the 6" by 6" steel plate big enough for the magnet. I did this with a jigsaw so you can see me in the picture cleaning up the rough edges with a dremel. I removed steel here for the same reason I added it on the back. This is because the magnet sticking to metal on one side weakens the field on that side and stengthens it on the other. I used this to my benifit when I added a plate on the back because I want the field coming out of the top into the chamber to be strong. But having steel here where the top of the magnets are would have had the opposite effect. So by cutting this hole I keep the target material rigid enough for vaccum, but leave a small section of only copper where the magnet can rest directly against it.</figcaption>

    <img src="magnetron/IMG_0383.JPEG" />
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Here is the finished target with the steel plate epoxied on. That hole in the center where the copper shows is where the magnets nestle in.</figcaption>

    <figcaption class="figure-caption">I used JB weld to attach 2 3D-Printed tabs to each of the outer edges. These tabs hold the target plate in place because the magnets try to move the plate so they touch the steel portion(cant let that happen). </figcaption>
