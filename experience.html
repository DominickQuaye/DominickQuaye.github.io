      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Soldering:</strong> I have been using my own Soldering Iron for 5 years now. I have good experience with
        the basics using both lead and silver solder. I regularly do large wire to wire and component to circuit
        board
        soldering.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3D printing:</strong> Designed and printed numerous parts using Autodesk and SolidWorks (mainly
        tinkercad). Some of my designs can be found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/Dominick777/designs"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SolidWorks:</strong> Beginner level experience from self teaching. .STL of my most recent build is
        attached on my thingiverse profile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rotary vane vacuum pumps:</strong> I have completely disassembled, cleaned and repaired a Welch 8920A,
        taking it from unusable to great working condition. It is now capable of reaching a pressure of ~5 microns. I
        Spent over 150 hours doing this, so I would say I know the in's and outs of rotary vane pumps and could use,
        repair, or maintain ones of different brands.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Oil diffusion Pumps:</strong> I have disassembled, and am currently repairing a 30in oil diffusion pump
        from the 1970s. I would say I have a good understanding of how these pumps work and how to use/care for them.
