    <h2>4" Racing Drone</h2>
    <p>
      Seen above is the 4" homemade racing drone I made for only $90. The
      drone is extremely fun to fly and can reach speeds up to 100mph. The
      build uses 4 Samguk 2700kv motors ($8 each), 4 (???) ESCs ($? each), 4
      basic polycarbonate props (75C each), 1 omnibus F4 flight controller
      ($24), 1 FlySky 2.4ghz receiver ($12), and one basic 4" carbon fiber
      drone frame ($15).

    <h3>Soldering Flight controller, ESCs, and Motors</h3>
    <p>
      I started trimming the motor wires to the right length and stripping
      them. I then tinned the ESCs solder pads and attached the motors. Next I
      trimmed and desolded the unused signal wire on the other side of the
      ESCs and removed their plastic casing to provide better direct
      air-cooling during flight. After that I tinned the pads on the flight
      controler and trimmed the ESCs remaining signal cable. I then soldered
      the positive, ground, and signal cables from the ESC to the flight
      controler.

    <h3>Soldering Battery Connector</h3>
    <p>
      The flight controller comes without a battery cable, so I made that as
      well. I used a few inches of low gauge stranded copper wire from a
      microwave, soldered it to a female XT60 connector, and finished it off
      with shrink wrap to prevent any shorts. I tinned the battery pads on the
      flight controler and then soldered the other side of the cables on.

    </div>
    <h3>Receiver</h3>
    <p>
      The final soldering I did on the flight controller was for the receiver.
      I first located the positive, ground, and 3 different signal options on
      the board using the manufacturing diagram. The 3 options for signal were
      I-Bus, S-Bus, PPM. All of these options were entirely compatible with my
      receiver and my flight controller, but I ultimately ended up using PPM
      because I had a really hard time getting I-Bus and S-Bus to work on the
      software side. After I decided on my 3 pins I soldered the stripped ends
      of a 3 wire female connector to the board. The connector then plugged
      into the respective positive, ground, and PPM leads on the receiver.

    <h3>Making Charger</h3>
    <p>
      The LiPO battery charger I have requires a 12 to 24 volt DC input but
      doesn't have its own step-down transformer or rectifier, so I had to
      make my own power supply. I did this using an old laptop charger which
      already had a 24VDC output. I cut off the plug that goes into the
      computer and stripped the cable, which strangely had 4 cables. I used my
      multimeter to determine which were positive and negative and then cut
      off the extras. I then soldered on a male XT60 connector (so it could
      plug in to the battery charger) and added shrink wrap.

    </div>
    <h3>Antenna Connections</h3>
    <p>
      Because I bought the frame with all needed parts, the main mechanical
      challenge in building this drone was securing the antennas. Securing the
      antennas is essential because the drone moves violently throughout a
      flight and if the antennas break loose they will be shredded by the
      propellers. However if they are secured too tightly in a vulnerable
      position, they are often the first to break during a crash. I solved
      both these issues with the setup shown above. Each of these antenna
      holders consists of sheet aluminum base and a modified plastic spacer. I
      first drilled out the pacer to make its internal diameter fit that of
      the antennas. I then shaved the bottoms flat so they could be secured to
      the base. I cut the base out of thin aluminum from a microwave cover,
      and drilled two holes on either side so screws could run through them
      into the standoffs. I then glued the spacers onto the base at a 45
      degree angle to match the back legs of the drone. This gave the 2
      antennas the 90 degree total angle needed to maximize range. It also
      kept the antennas snug up against the much stronger legs of the drone,
      thus making it virtually impossible for them to directly hit the ground
      in the event of a crash.

    <h3>Software</h3>
    <p>
      I chose to run Betaflight on my flight controller, as it is a very
      powerful software that is relatively easy to use. I flashed my ESCs
      using BLHeli because it was the manufacturer's recommended firmware.
      BLHeli made switching motor directions very convenient, which was great
      because I had a lot of trouble with the rotors turning the wrong way
      early on.

    <h2>Competitive Robotics</h2>
    <p>
      I have done competitive robotics with VEX team 8000 for 6 years now. In
      my time on the team I have built (and sometimes programmed) over 20
      large robots all with 5 or more different functions. Over the course of
      1 month in the 2017-2018 season, A team I led was ranked #2 in the world
      for our skills score. Here are some of the robots I worked on with
      descriptions:
    </p>
    <h3>VEX Tower Takeover 11 StackBot</h3>
    <p>
      This robot is meant to pick up and vertically stack up to 11 cubes for
      the VEX Tower Takeover. It uses two rollers driven by two motors to
      intake and elevate the stack. The tray that holds the cubes is divided
      into 3 18ï¿½ sections that fold inward to keep the robot within 18ï¿½ by
      18ï¿½ by 18ï¿½ at the beginning of the match. The folding works by
      having each successive section be ~2mm thinner than the last, and
      external hinges, which allows them to fold neatly into each other. The
      fold out is powered passively using preloaded elastic force which Is
      released by the movement of the outer arms. The two outer arms that the
      rollers mount on are independent from the tray and attached to a single
      motor at a 1:7 gear ratio, allowing for the arm to lift up multiple feet
      to place single cubes in elevated containers. Finally the tray is moved
      to its vertical orientation by a 1 joint arm powered by a single motor
      geared 1:21. Finally, the robot drives using a 4 motor chassis chained
      together to eliminate the effect of motor strength inconsistencies.ï¿½

      This robot was primarily designed to be successful in the skills
      challenge, which it was. This robot was ranked #2 in the world for about
      a month in the 2017-2018 season. Because it was meant for skills, my
      design focus was on simplicity, efficiency, and speed. The chassis is a
      simple 6 motor tank drive with wheels and motors chained together to
      reduce the effects of motor strength inconsistencies. They were geared
      to high speed to make the robot faster. The robots objective was to pick
      up the 4 pound caps and place them in the scoring zones. The pronged arm
      in the front was built to rest a few mm off the ground and grab the
      underside of the cones. This based height was also regulated with a
      potentiometer. The arm lifts the cones off the ground where they then
      slide into the storage tray. The arm lifts using an asymmetric 4-bar
      driven by 2 low speed motors geared 7:1. The asymmetry of the 4bar means
      that the fork and cone do not stay level and gradually lean back as the
      bar lifts up. This allows for the cone to slide nicly down the angled
      tray. The tray consists of some metal c-channel at a ~35 degree angle.
      It is covered in polycarbonate sheeting to lower the friction between
      itself and the cone. Since the robot was meant to hold up to 2 cones at
      once, a removable stopping mechanism was made. It is basically just a
      very rigid axle extension that forms a wall and stops the cone when it
      is vertical, and gets completely out of the way when it is horizontal.
      The stopper is driven by one motor geared 1:3 connected to a high
      strength steel axel. Encoders were also attached to the chassis,
      allowing for very accurate movements to be made consistently. I also
      made the 1 minute long autonomous program for this robot. I started by
      making basic adjustable encoder functions line by line to do things like
      lift the arm, engage and disengage the stopper, turn left, drive forward
      ext. From then on creating the program involved figuring out what
      functions to call in what order and to what degree. After that I had to
      optimize everything for speed and consistency to make it within the 1
      min and 3 try limit. Finally to give the robot some edge in match
      competition, a flip out arm was added. When deployed the U-Shaped arm
      prevents the opposing team from getting 2 cones that are vital for
      victory. By doing this we could prevent even the best teams from winning
      because they couldn't even use the game objects their robots were
      designed for. This was so effective that we defeated the defending world
      champions in an elimination match at worlds. The arm deploys using
      preloaded elastic force which is triggered by a motor based mechanical
      release. See Images of the robot above

    <h3>VEX Startstruck Clawbot</h3>

    <p>
      This robot was meant to carry out the VEX Starstruck challenge, which
      involved throwing large heavy game objects over a 3ft fence onto the
      opponent's side. It has a simple chained 4 motor high speed chassis. To
      throw the objects, a lightweight 4 motor arm geared 1:7 is connected to
      the back chassis tower. The motors are assisted on the upswing by
      elastic bands which store energy as the arm goes down. The objects are
      grasped using a large pneumatic claw made of aluminum c-channel. The
      pneumatics are fueled by two small air tanks pressurized to ~100psi.
      This gives the claw far more than enough grasp cycles to make it through
      the typical 2 minute match. To fit the size requirements, the whole claw
      is placed on a hinge, allowing it to fold backwards. When the arm lifts
      at the beginning of the match the claw flips out and is held in place by
      a passive locking mechanism. Finally, a passively deployed Tip-Guard
      flips out and mechanically locks providing stability, preventing a
      backwards tip when throwing a heavy load.

    <h3>VEX Turning Point Double Catapult Double Intake Bot</h3>
    <p>
      I made this robot to compete in the Vex turning point game. Its purpose
      was to intake small plastic balls and precisely shoot them to hit flags
      stationed on the field. It also needed to flip plastic disks and climb a
      central platform. Early in the season I realized 2 things: the first was
      that the game was highly defence based and physical, and second was that
      being able to hit 2 flags simultaneously was a huge advantage. Because
      of this I decided to make an extremely strong, tank-like bot that could
      play good defence and also do well on offence by shooting 2 balls at
      once. While most teams had intakes on one side of their bot, I had huge
      intakes on both sides. This provided a huge advantage in terms of being
      able to rapidly collect balls because the size of the intakes gave a
      huge margin of error when driving, and also allowed for omni-directional
      operation (if there was a ball on both sides of the robot, we could
      simply drive forward and backwards quickly, instead of turning around).
      The Intakes also provided a much more important role than just picking
      up balls. I built the intakes using thick axles and chose polycarbonate
      instead of the typical rubber bands. In addition I used 3 motors for my
      intake where other teams used only one. Because of this the intake made
      the robot almost unbeatable defense wise. By running the intake
      backwards, the polycarbonate sheets would literally lift the opposing
      team off the ground, making it impossible for them to resist our pushes.
      In addition, the polycarbonate easily shredded the rubber band intake of
      any team who dared to come near us. This effect allowed us to win the
      semi-finals of the California state championship, as a team that would
      have normally beaten us was rendered useless when we broke their intake,
      making it impossible for them to pick up balls. Our scoring ability was
      also very high, as the double catapult was extremely consistent. We also
      boasted a very high skills score.

      This Robot was meant to compete in the VEX In The Zone game. Itï¿½s goal
      is to stack cones on the mobile goals and place them in the scoring
      zones. It has a 4 motor chassis with a very lightweight build. It grabs
      and elevates the mobile coals with a tray very similar to the skills bot
      presented earlier. The cones are picked up using a 1 motor roller that
      directs them into a passive polycarbonate gripper that mechanically
      locks on to the contours of the cone. The cone is then added to the
      stack with a 4 bar that moves the gripper from its intake position to
      above the mobile goal. In a downward sweeping potion the arm pushes the
      cone onto the stack to the point that the passive lock disengages, and
      the arm can move back to the intake position. As the stack grows
      vertically, a 3 motor double reverse 4 bar elevates the stacker to
      continue adding to the top. Itï¿½s lifting speed is assisted by elastic
      bands between the first and second 4 bars that store energy as the lift
      goes down and release it when they go up. The nature of the 4 bar also
      ensures that the stacker is always perfectly aligned above the mobile
      goal regardless of its height. The robot's two batteries are placed on
      hinged arms on the back which combat the weight of the stack in the
      front. Finally a elastically powered 1-use cone shooter is mounted on
      the top to disrupt the opponent at the beginning of the match. One
      single preload cone is placed on itï¿½s sled and is shot at the other
      team when the preloaded elastic bands accelerate it. The launcher
      passively deploys as soon as the double reverse 4-bar moves at the
      beginning of autonomous. See images of the double reverse 4 bar in
      action below.
