    <h2>Epoxy River Table</h2>
    <p>
      This is probably the woodworking piece I am most proud of. I started with a 3ï¿½ section pine board, cutting it
      with
      a bandsaw down the middle in a random wavy pattern. When separated the two ï¿½halfsï¿½ form the river seen in the
      end result. I also cut out 8 sections of smaller pine stock to make the legs. I stained them all with a red
      mahogany. By doing this I was able to get the look of high quality wood while only using $20 worth of stock pine
      from Home Depot. I then made a custom frame for the tabletop to sit in while I epoxy it. I then coated the frame
      and
      the base in packing tape which doesn't stick to epoxy. This allowed me to pull out the tabletop out of the frame
      cleanly later on. After setting the top in the frame I mixed enough epoxy to fill up the central ï¿½riverï¿½
      halfway. I added blue dye to add to the effect. After pouring it in I spent about 30 min popping the bubbles/ air
      pockets in the epoxy using a lighter. I repeated this process once more to fill the river to about 90% capacity.
      Afterwards I mixed a batch of clear epoxy and filled the rest of the river and covered the surface of the table
      with
      a thin coating as well. I then removed the tabletop and attached the legs thus finishing the piece.

    <h2>Lichtenberg Fractal Epoxy Table</h2>
    <p>
      While it may not look like it this table was made using only stained plywood. I began by cutting a section of
      scrap
      Plywood into the correct tabletop dimensions and staining it. I then coated it in my saturated woodburing solution
      and used my lichtenberg burner. For this burn I didn't use current control, as I was looking for a large central
      burn rather than smaller detailed ones. Thus this burn probably pulled around 1 amp continuously off the
      secondary.
      I then rinsed and scrubbed the surface to prevent bleaching. Afterward I covered the surface in epoxy to make the
      tabletop more appealing and watertight for use as a coffee table. The legs we made with cheap pine 2ï¿½x2ï¿½ stock
      from Home Depot which I attached and then stained.

    <h2>Lichtenberg fractal burned skateboard</h2>
    <p>
      I used my fractal burner on a bunch of skateboard decks. I used my water resistor to ballast the burner, thus
      limiting the current and preventing the burns from going too deep into the wood. I did this because deeper burns
      might have damaged the structural integrity of the boards.

    <h2>Lightenburg burned artistic Clothes hanger</h2>
    <p>
      This project was rather simple. I began by burning both sides of a 7ï¿½6ï¿½ section of higher end stock wood. I
      then
      cut it into thirds to form the base and 2 sides. I screwed them together and then used 2 pieces of scrap steel
      from
      a broken TV to support the joint. I then drilled out two holes to accept a large dowel.

    <h2>Lichtenberg Fractal burner</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>SAFETY:</strong> It is important to note that this woodworking technique is extremely dangerous, and
      around
      5-10 people die every year trying it. That being said I want to make clear that I am taking proper precautions.
      The
      wood is all pre-wetted (no adding conductive solution while it's on) and the nail system means the burning can be
      operated and monitored from a distance. I also have a safety switch system which prevents others from operating
      the
      device. Because of these safety steps I have taken, doing lichtenburg burning with my setup is not at all
      dangerous
      or irresponsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made my Lichtenberg fractal burner using a Microwave oven transformer. I began by making a wooden box with
      rubber
      shunts on the bottom for insulation. I then drilled two holes for the 2100VAC leads and one to feed in the mains
      cord. I placed the transformer in the box on top of rubber washers for further isolation/safety. I attached a cord
      from the disassembled microwave to supply the needed 120VAC. I attached higher gauge 2100V cables taken from an
      old
      speaker and attached them to thin nails. These nails are then nailed into the wood and deliver the current from
      where they make contact.
